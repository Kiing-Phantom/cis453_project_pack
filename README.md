# CIS453L Course Project
The site that has been created here is a simple mockup of a physical music marketplace, 
where users can both purchase and sell physical copies of their favorite music.

There are many applications that are used as different marketplaces around the internet,
and while some of them began in an area similar to where they are today, some of them
also found themselves starting in very different (or smaller) areas. For this reason,
I thought that the idea of a marketplace that works to bring smaller music shops
together to create a much larger inventory and presence for their audience would be a
great way to start a marketplace.
